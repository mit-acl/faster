#Params for FASTER

use_ff: true # use feedforward
visual: true #publish visualization stuff
dc: 0.01            #(seconds) Duration for the interpolation=Value of the timer pubGoal
goal_radius: 0.3    #[m] Drone has arrived to the goal when distance_to_goal<GOAL_RADIUS
drone_radius: 0.3  #[m] Used for collision checking
rviz_goal_height: 1  #[m] Assumed height for clicked 2d nav goals in Rviz  (overridden for ground robots)

N_whole: 6 #[-] Number of discretization points in the whole trajectory
N_safe: 6 #[-] Number of discretization points in the safe path

Ra: 4.0            # [m] Radius of the sphere S
w_max: 1          # [rd/s] Maximum angular velocity. 0.4 for Hardware
alpha_filter_dyaw: 0 #was 0.92  #[] Filter parameter for dyaw, \in [0,1]. Higher--> More aggressive filtering

z_ground: -0.2         #[m] points below this are considered ground
z_max: 2         #[m] JPS is not allowed to give a solution that goes higher than this height
inflation_jps: 0.35  #[m] The obstacles are inflated (to run JPS) by this amount

dist_max_vertexes: 1.5 #[m] Maximum distance between two vertexes in the JPS before doing the cvx decomp (more vertexes are added to force this)
gurobi_threads: 1 #[threads] Number of threads that Gurobi will use. If computer is maxed out, threads=1 works faster!
gurobi_verbose: 0 #Verbosity of Gurobi. 0 or 1

use_faster: true  #TODO (this param doesn't work yet) if false, it will plan only in free space
